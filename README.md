# Morse-Code-Translator-Brap-Edition-

I was incredibly passionate of the lyric "Brap Brap! I am Hercules Mulligan!" from the broadway musical Hamilton, that I made a morse code translator, but with a twist. A dot is a "Brap" and a dash is a "BrapBrap." This was built on google colab for my friends to also use, but this was my personal file that also had a UI. Please enjoy!
